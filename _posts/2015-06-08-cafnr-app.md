In the Fall of 2013, I was subcontracted to build my first (non homework assignment) iOS app. The project was for the University of Missouri's College of Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources (CAFNR). After completing the university's Mobile Application Development the previous semester, and TA'ing for the same course in Fall of 2013, this was my first major undertaking in Objective-C.

After several months of hard work, catching bugs (a lot of those, admittedly, but it was my first big app), carefully matching the layouts to the mockups, and support from my mentor developers Tyten Teegarden and Geoff Pado, the [CAFNR App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cafnr/id874603725?mt=8) hit the App Store.

The class was the starting point, but it was that app that truly brought me into the often frustrating, but very rewarding profession of mobile application development.
